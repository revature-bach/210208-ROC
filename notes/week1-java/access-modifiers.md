# Access Modifiers
Access modifiers help to restrict the accessibility of a class, constructor, field, or method. We have four possible access modifiers in Java, from most restrictive to least:
1. private
    - Allows for access only within the same class
2. default
    - it is the access modifier level whenever we don't explicitly give an access modifier to a class member
    - allows for access from any class in the same package
    - the `default` keyword is different from the default access modifier
3. protected
    - allows for access within the same package and subclasses outside that package
4. public
    - Allows for access anywhere
