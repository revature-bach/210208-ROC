# Expectations

The ROC program consists of 4 weeks of training

## Timeline
1st week: Java
2nd week: SQL + JDBC / design pattern
- Project will be assigned in the 2nd week
3rd week: Advanced Java concepts, but most of the day will be for you to work on projects
4th week: same thing, presentations would likely be on Thursday of this week or Friday
- Presentations would be around 5 minutes

## Second week evaluations
In the second week, we will have
1. one-on-ones: with me, in which I will be asking some technical questions related to Java
2. QC: same thing, but with somebody other than me, and it will not be one-on-one. This one will likely be in a small group with other people in separate breakout rooms, or just an entire huge room.
3. Java quiz (40 or 50): This one will be on RevaturePro, so make sure you have access to an account there and that you can view the batch information

## Third week
Same thing
- one-on-ones
- QC
- Some SQL quiz + JDBC

## Fourth week
- Project presentations
- Practice quiz w/ similar questions you might encounter on the OJA exam
