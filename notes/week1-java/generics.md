# Java: Generics
Generics were added in Java 5 to provide compile-time checking and also helps to remove the risk of ClassCastException. This allows us to achieve **type-safety**, especially when using `Java Collections`.

Java allows us to define classes with generic types, which are classes or interfaces that are parameterized. We can use angle brackets to specify parameter type.
