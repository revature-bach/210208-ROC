# Java: Arrays
Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory storing sequentially stored elements **OF THE SAME TYPE**. Some important properties of arrays in Java include
- Arrays are a fixed size, so once they are instantiated (**arrays are objects, by the way**), their size cannot change
- Variables in an array are ordered and have indices beginning from 0
- The size of an array must be specified by an int value (not long or short, etc.)
- Can be multi-dimensional (array or arrays)
- The length of an array can be found by accessing its length field
